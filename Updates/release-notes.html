    <tr><th>Pester 1.1 beta 16 ()</th></tr>
    <tr><td><ul>
        <li>Added Notification Center alerts on OS X Mountain Lion
        (10.8) and later.  Use the Notifications System Preferences
        pane to customize the alert style and behavior. If you select
        the Alerts style, you can click the “Stop Alerts” button in an
        alert to stop any other alerts in progress (dock bouncing,
        sounds or speech), equivalent to the same-named item in
        Pester’s Alarm menu.  Unlike Growl, Notification Center only
        supports one type of alert per application, so the time
        remaining confirmation is not displayed as an OS X alert.  If
        you have Growl installed, it will still be used for this
        purpose unless you’ve turned it off.</li>
        <li>Optionally disable display of the time remaining until the
        next alarm in Pester’s Dock icon, in Preferences. (Thanks to
        Nur Monson for the contribution.)</li>
        <li>Permit entry of 12-hour single-digit hour/minute times
        without punctuation.  For example, you can now type
        “930a”.</li>
        <li>Remove an item from the Edit menu that didn’t do anything
        useful and should not have been there.</li>
        <li>Add Retina calendar and volume icons.</li>
        <li>Improve display of certain sound device names (such as
        those of AirPlay devices) to be consistent with the Sound menu
        extra.</li>
        <li>Update the natural language date
        parser, <tt>Date::Manip</tt>.</li>
        <li>Improve display of long alarm messages in the alarm list
        window.</li>
        <li>Optional log expired alarms to the Console.  (Note that
        you can also view expired alarms in Growl or Notification
        Center, if you have the corresponding alert enabled.)  This is
        not exposed in Pester’s user interface, but you can quit
        Pester, type <tt>defaults write net.sabi.Pester
        PesterLogAlarmTimerExpired -bool YES</tt> in Terminal and
        restart Pester to enable logging; replace <tt>YES</tt>
        with <tt>NO</tt> to disable logging.  (Thanks to Mikey Reppy
        for the suggestion.)</li>

    <tr><th>Pester 1.1 beta 15 (48)</th></tr>
    <tr><td><ul>
	<li>Fix rare instances where the Dock displays an inaccurate
	time remaining.</li>
	<li>Fix Read Me losing its section navigation.  (If you're
	viewing the Read Me on a Retina display, you may find it gains
	unwanted horizontal scrolling.  To work around this issue,
	close and reopen the Read Me window.)</li>
	<li>Fix natural-language date processing on OS X Mountain
	Lion.</li>
	<li>Permit entry of single-digit hour/minute times without
	punctuation or an initial zero.  For example, you can now type
	“930” for 9:30, where previously “0930” or “9:30” was
	required.</li>
	<li>Don’t require the discrete GPU on MacBook Pro models from
	early 2011 and later, on OS X Lion or later. If you’re using
	an earlier OS X version or an older multi-GPU MacBook Pro,
	Apple provides no way for Pester to “opt out” of the discrete
	GPU.  You may find <a
	href="http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus">gfxCardStatus</a>
	helpful as a workaround.</li>
	<li>Update Growl framework to 1.2.3.</li>
	<li>Update Sparkle to work around a problem with update
	verification that only occurred after recent OS X security
	updates.</li>
	<li>Sign with Developer ID for Gatekeeper on OS X Mountain
	Lion (10.8).</li>

        <li>Avoid a crash that can be triggered by dragging the volume
        slider quickly on OS X Lion.  To ensure accurate volume
        preview, drag the slider more slowly (or use the keyboard if
        full keyboard access is enabled).</li>
	<li>Fix a problem with relative date/time display where the
	cutoff for a larger unit was 999 hours/days; now displays
	smaller units up to twice the larger unit.  Multiple units are
	still only used up to &ldquo;days and hours&rdquo;, not
	&ldquo;weeks and days&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Fix a few minor visual glitches on OS X Lion.</li>
	<li>Update Growl framework to 1.2.2 for compatibility with
	Growl 1.3 (OS X Lion only).</li>

        Pester to support Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5.</li>

        <li>Fix problem where Pester keyboard equivalents involving the “A” key would not be assigned.</li>
        <li>Wake up the display when a message is displayed.  By putting the display to sleep with ⌃⇧⏏ after setting an alarm, you can thus use Pester as an effective visual alarm.  (Just make sure your Mac doesn’t go to sleep or enter a locking screen saver before the alarm expires.)</li>

	    <li>If Growl is installed, display an alarm’s time remaining when it is set as a confirmation.  You can disable this from the Growl System Preferences pane as well.</li>
	    <li>Fix Preferences not displaying on Mac OS X 10.4.</li>
	    <li>Fix intermittent failure to play the correct speech voice.</li>

	<tr><th>Pester 1.1 beta 8 (31)</th></tr>
	<tr><td><ul>
	    <li>Added customizable alert sounds—the most requested feature. The feature uses QuickTime, so you're welcome to pick a movie or even a bitmap or PDF to use instead.</li>
	    <li>Added selectable sound output device (in Preferences) and adjustable volume for alert sounds. (Note: Pester doesn't yet respond to audio devices being connected/disconnected while it is running, although you should always get audio output <em>somewhere</em>.)</li>
	    <li>Baseline, ICU-based support for non-natural language dates and times is much more robust (for example, simply “20” or “8p” works to specify 8:00 PM).</li>
	    <li>Support natural-language dates in non-English languages via <tt>Date::Manip</tt>. I uncovered some bugs here, which the author of <tt>Date::Manip</tt> is working on fixing, but Catalan, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Polish and Russian should work fine. The date popup is limited to the days of the week, for now.</li>
	    <li>Optionally wait until you stop typing or moving the mouse to display a message. This is quite helpful so you don't start typing into the Snooze box when you want to be typing into another document. The feature is disabled by default; enable it in Preferences.</li>
	    <li>Handle time zone changes, many more time zones, and more reliably determine the time zone.</li>
	    <li>Autocomplete common natural-language dates.</li>
	    <li>Simplify tab ordering.</li>
	    <li>Better save and restore focus when you're working as an alarm goes off; will no longer bring unwanted windows to the front.</li>
	    <li>Open the Set Alarm window in the current Space when triggered with a keyboard equivalent or the Dock menu.</li>
	    <li>Switch to tomorrow automatically if necessary when tabbing into “on”. If you specify a time that's already passed, while the specified date is today, simply tabbing into the date field will switch the date to tomorrow.</li>
	    <li>Display “today” and “tomorrow” in the bottom left corner of the Set Alarm window.</li>
	    <li>Open the Set Alarm window in the current Space when triggered with a keyboard equivalent or the Dock menu.</li>
	    <li>If the Set Alarm window was visible when Pester was last active, prevent it from switching Spaces and obscuring a notification alert.</li>
	    <li>(Re-)added optional dock icon bouncing, which works more reliably.</li>
	    <li>Restored “today” item to date completion menus.</li>
	    <li>Fix horizontal resizing glitches in the Alarms window.</li>
	    <li>Save the most recent alarm message across runs of Pester.</li>
	    <li>Disable the “–” button when it would do nothing.</li>
            <li>Added “days” and “weeks” alarm interval units.</li>
	    <li>Allow specifying intervals up to 999 weeks.</li>
